# Linux-shell-scripts
A collection of production-ready Bash scripts for Linux system administration tasks such as service checks, automation, and operational health validation.These scripts are developed and tested on Amazon Linux 2, but are written in a portable way so they can run on other major Linux distributions with minimal or no changes.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository
  This repository is intended to:
  1. Serve as a learning and reference project for Bash scripting.
  2. Provide reusable operational scripts for Linux administrators and DevOps engineers.
  3. Demonstrate best practices in scripting (error handling, logging, portability).
  4. Grow over time as more scripts are added.

🔐 Permissions & Security Notes
  1. Scripts should be reviewed before running in production.
  2. Avoid running as root unless required.
  3. Never hard-code secrets or credentials.
  4. Use environment variables when needed.
